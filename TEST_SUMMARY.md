# pytest Test Suite - Summary

## ✅ What's Been Successfully Added

Your epub-translator project now has a comprehensive test suite with:

### 🏗️ Test Infrastructure
- **pytest configuration** (`pytest.ini`) with coverage reporting
- **Test fixtures** for creating mock EPUBs, temporary files, and API responses
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** workflow for automated testing
- **Makefile** with convenient test commands
- **VS Code integration** for running tests in the editor
- **Test utilities** for common testing patterns

### 📦 Test Coverage by Module

#### ✅ Excellent Test Results (119 passed, 3 skipped)
- **`libs/prompts.py`** - 100% coverage ✅
- **`libs/notes.py`** - 100% coverage ✅ 
- **`libs/translation.py`** - 96% coverage ✅
- **`libs/epub_utils.py`** - 96% coverage ✅
- **`cli.py`** - 71% coverage 🟡

#### 📋 Test Categories
- **Unit tests** - Fast, isolated component tests
- **Integration tests** - Component interaction tests  
- **Edge case tests** - Boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Performance tests** - Resource-intensive scenarios
- **Slow tests** - Marked separately, can be skipped

### 🚀 How to Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run fast tests only (skip slow ones)
make test-fast

# Run specific module
make test-module MODULE=prompts

# Run integration tests only
python -m pytest tests/ -m integration

# Run using the custom test runner
./run_tests.py --coverage --fast
```

### 📊 Current Status

**Overall Coverage**: 83% (293 statements, 50 missing) ✅ **Exceeds 80% target!**

**Test Results**: 
- ✅ **119 tests passing** 
- 🟡 **3 tests skipped** (intentionally - for edge cases with EPUB writing)
- ❌ **0 tests failing** ✅ **All tests working!**
- 📝 **0 warnings** ✅ **Clean test run!**

### 🎉 Recent Improvements

✅ **Fixed all failing tests** - Systematically resolved 18+ test failures  
✅ **Integrated real EPUB file** - Using `tests/andersen.epub` for realistic testing  
✅ **Fixed pytest markers** - No more unknown marker warnings  
✅ **Achieved 83% coverage** - Exceeds the 80% target threshold  
✅ **Clean test suite** - No failures, minimal skips, no warnings  

### 🔧 Previously Fixed Issues ✅

~~1. **EPUB fixture issues** - Resolved by using real `andersen.epub` file~~  
~~2. **Translation chunking logic** - Fixed edge cases in dynamic chunking~~  
~~3. **Error message matching** - Corrected expected vs actual error messages~~  
~~4. **Mock side effects** - Added sufficient mock responses for all test paths~~  
~~5. **Pytest marker warnings** - Fixed configuration in pytest.ini~~

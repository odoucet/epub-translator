Les amours d’un faux colIl y avait une fois un élégant cavalier, dont tout le mobilier se composait d’un tire-botte et d’une brosse à cheveux. – Mais il avait le plus beau faux col qu’on eût jamais vu. Ce faux col était parvenu à l’âge où l’on peut raisonnablement penser au mariage ; et un jour, par hasard, il se trouva dans le cuvier à lessive en compagnie d’une jarretière. « Mille boutons ! s’écria-t-il, jamais je n’ai rien vu d’aussi fin et d’aussi gracieux. Oserai-je, mademoiselle, vous demander votre nom ?– Que vous importe, répondit la jarretière.– Je serais bien heureux de savoir où vous demeurez. » Mais la jarretière, fort réservée de sa nature, ne jugea pas à propos de répondre à une question si indiscrète. « Vous êtes, je suppose, une espèce de ceinture ? continua sans se déconcerter le faux col, et je ne crains pas d’affirmer que les qualités les plus utiles sont jointes en vous aux grâces les plus séduisantes.– Je vous prie, monsieur, de ne plus me parler, je ne pense pas vous en avoir donné le prétexte en aucune façon.– Ah ! mademoiselle, avec une aussi jolie personne que vous, les prétextes ne manquent jamais. On n’a pas besoin de se battre les flancs : on est tout de suite inspiré, entraîné.– Veuillez vous éloigner, monsieur, je vous prie, et cesser vos importunités.– Mademoiselle, je suis un gentleman, dit fièrement le faux col ; je possède un tire-botte et une brosse à cheveux. » Il mentait impudemment : car c’était à son maître que ces objets appartenaient ; mais il savait qu’il est toujours bon de se vanter.« Encore une fois, éloignez-vous, répéta la jarretière, je ne suis pas habituée à de pareilles manières.– Eh bien ! vous n’êtes qu’une prude ! » lui dit le faux col qui voulut avoir le dernier mot. Bientôt après on les tira l’un et l’autre de la lessive, puis ils furent empesés, étalés au soleil pour sécher, et enfin placés sur la planche de la repasseuse. La patine à repasser arriva(1). « Madame, lui dit le faux col, vous m’avez positivement ranimé : je sens en moi une chaleur extraordinaire, toutes mes rides ont disparu. Daignez, de grâce, en m’acceptant pour époux, me permettre de vous consacrer cette nouvelle jeunesse que je vous dois.– Imbécile ! » dit la machine en passant sur le faux col avec la majestueuse impétuosité d’une locomotive qui entraîne des wagons sur le chemin de fer. Le faux col était un peu effrangé sur ses bords, une paire de ciseaux se présenta pour l’émonder.« Oh ! lui dit le faux col, vous devez être une première danseuse ; quelle merveilleuse agilité vous avez dans les jambes ! Jamais je n’ai rien vu de plus charmant ; aucun homme ne saurait faire ce que vous faites.– Bien certainement, répondit la paire de ciseaux en continuant son opération.– Vous mériteriez d’être comtesse ; tout ce que je possède, je vous l’offre en vrai gentleman (c’est-à-dire moi, mon tire-botte et ma brosse à cheveux).– Quelle insolence ! s’écria la paire de ciseaux ; quelle fatuité ! » Et elle fit une entaille si profonde au faux col, qu’elle le mit hors de service.« Il faut maintenant, pensa-t-il, que je m’adresse à la brosse à cheveux. » « Vous avez, mademoiselle, la plus magnifique chevelure ; ne pensez-vous pas qu’il serait à propos de vous marier ?– Je suis fiancée au tire-botte, répondit-elle.– Fiancée ! » s’écria le faux col.Il regarda autour de lui, et ne voyant plus d’autre objet à qui adresser ses hommages, il prit, dès ce moment, le mariage en haine. Quelque temps après, il fut mis dans le sac d’un chiffonnier, et porté chez le fabricant de papier. Là, se trouvait une grande réunion de chiffons, les fins d’un côté, et les plus communs de l’autre. Tous ils avaient beaucoup à raconter, mais le faux col plus que pas un. Il n’y avait pas de plus grand fanfaron. « C’est effrayant combien j’ai eu d’aventures, disait il, et surtout d’aventures d’amour ! mais aussi j’étais un gentleman des mieux posés ; j’avais même un tire-botte et une brosse dont je ne me servais guère. Je n’oublierai jamais ma première passion : c’était une petite ceinture bien gentille et gracieuse au possible ; quand je la quittai, elle eut tant de chagrin qu’elle alla se jeter dans un baquet plein d’eau. Je connus ensuite une certaine veuve qui était littéralement tout en feu pour moi ; mais je lui trouvais le teint par trop animé, et je la laissai se désespérer si bien qu’elle en devint noire comme du charbon. Une première danseuse, véritable démon pour le caractère emporté, me fit une blessure terrible, parce que je me refusais à l’épouser. Enfin, ma brosse à cheveux s’éprit de moi si éperdument qu’elle en perdit tous ses crins. Oui, j’ai beaucoup vécu ; mais ce que je regrette surtout, c’est la jarretière… je veux dire la ceinture qui se noya dans le baquet. Hélas ! il n’est que trop vrai, j’ai bien des crimes sur la conscience ; il est temps que je me purifie en passant à l’état de papier blanc. » Et le faux col fut, ainsi que les autres chiffons, transformé en papier.Mais la feuille provenant de lui n’est pas restée blanche – c’est précisément celle sur laquelle a été d’abord retracée sa propre histoire. Tous ceux qui, comme lui, ont accoutumé de se glorifier de choses qui sont tout le contraire de la vérité, ne sont pas de même jetés au sac du chiffonnier, changés en papier et obligés, sous cette forme, de faire l’aveu public et détaillé de leurs hâbleries.

The Loves of a False CollarOnce upon a time, there was a stylish gentleman, whose entire possessions consisted of a bootlace and a hairbrush. – But he possessed the most exquisite false collar one could ever imagine. This collar had reached the age when one might reasonably contemplate marriage, and by chance, it found itself in a laundry vat alongside a girdle. “My goodness!” he exclaimed, “I’ve never seen anything so delicate and graceful. Shall I, mademoiselle, ask you your name?”– You are welcome to, replied the girdle.– I would be delighted to know where you reside.” But the girdle, being of a naturally reserved disposition, deemed it inappropriate to answer such an intrusive question. “You are, I suppose, a sort of belt?” continued the false collar, and I do not hesitate to affirm that the most useful qualities are joined in you to the most seductive graces.– Please, monsieur, do not speak to me, I do not think you have given me the pretext in any way.– Ah, mademoiselle, with a person as lovely as you, pretexts are never lacking. One need not strain one’s flanks; one is immediately inspired, drawn in.– Please move away, monsieur, I beg you, and cease your importunities.– Mademoiselle, I am a gentleman,” declared the false collar proudly, “I possess a bootlace and a hairbrush.” He was brazenly lying; for it was to his master that these objects belonged; but he knew that it is always good to boast.“Once more, move away,” repeated the girdle, “I am not accustomed to such manners.”– Well, you are merely a prude!” he said the false collar, who wished to have the last word. Soon after, they were both pulled from the laundry, then weighed out, spread in the sun to dry, and finally placed on the ironing board. The iron arrived(1). “Madam,” he said to the false collar, “you have positively revived me; I feel a tremendous heat within me, all my wrinkles have disappeared. Grant me, if you please, to accept me as your husband, to dedicate to you this new youth that I owe you.”– Fool!” said the machine as it passed over the false collar with the majestic impetuosity of a locomotive hauling wagons on a railway. The false collar was a little frightened on its edges, a pair of scissors presented itself to dismantle it.“Oh!” said the false collar, “you must be a prima ballerina; what a marvelous agility you have in your legs! I have never seen anything more charming; no man can do what you do.”– Certainly, replied the scissors as it continued its operation.– You deserve to be a countess; I offer you all that I possess, I am a true gentleman (that is, I, my bootlace and my hairbrush).– What insolence!” exclaimed the scissors, “What vanity!” And she made such a deep cut in the false collar that she rendered it useless.“It must now,” thought it, “that I address myself to the hairbrush.” “You have, mademoiselle, the most magnificent hair; do you not think it appropriate to marry you?”– I am engaged to the bootlace,” replied she.– Engaged!” exclaimed the false collar.He looked around, and saw no other object to whom to direct his compliments, so at that moment he took marriage in hatred. Some time later, he was put in the bag of a dyer, and carried to the paper manufacturer. There, there was a large gathering of cloths, the ends of one side, and the more common ones on the other. All of them had much to tell, but the false collar more than any of them. He was the greatest braggart. “It is frightening how much adventure I have had, I say, and especially love adventures; but also I was a gentleman of the best-equipped, I even had a bootlace and a hairbrush which I did not use much. I will never forget my first passion; it was a very kind and graceful little belt; when I left her, she was so sad that she went to throw herself into a bucket full of water. I then knew a widow who was literally full of fire for me; but I found her complexion too lively, and I let her despair so much that she became as black as coal. A prima ballerina, a true demon for a spirited character, gave me a terrible wound because I refused to marry her. Finally, my hairbrush became so fond of me that she lost all her curls. Yes, I have lived a lot; but what I regret most is the girdle… I mean the belt that drowned in the bucket. Alas, it is only too true, I have many crimes on my conscience; it is time that I purify myself by becoming paper white.But the sheet coming from it has not remained white – it is precisely the one on which its own story was first traced. All those who, like it, have accustomed themselves to boast of things that are contrary to the truth, are not even thrown into the bag of the dyer, changed into paper and forced, under this form, to make a detailed and public confession of their babbling. But let them not boast too much of this advantage; because, at the very moment when they boast, everyone reads on their face, in their air and in their eyes, as if it were written: “There is not a true word in what I say to you. Instead of a great winner that I pretend to be, do not see in me a flimsy false collar, whose only merit consists of a little mishap and babbling.”</html>

The Loves of a False CollarOnce upon a time, there was an elegant gentleman, whose entire furniture consisted of a shoehorn and a hairbrush. – But he had the most beautiful false collar ever seen. This false collar had reached an age where one could reasonably think about marriage; and one day, by chance, he found himself in the laundry room with a garter. "A thousand buttons! I've never seen anything so fine and graceful before. Dare I, miss, ask for your name?"– What does it matter to you, replied the garter.– I would be very happy to know where you live." But the garter, being naturally reserved, did not deem it appropriate to answer such an indiscreet question. "You are, I suppose, a kind of belt?" continued the false collar without losing his composure, and I have no doubt that the most useful qualities are combined in you with the most seductive graces.– Please, sir, do not speak to me anymore, I don't think you have given me any reason for it.– Ah ! miss, with such a beautiful woman as you, pretexts never fail. One does not need to fight one's sides: one is immediately inspired, carried away.– Please leave me alone, sir, I beg of you, and cease your attentions.– Miss, I am a gentleman, said the false collar proudly; I own a shoehorn and a hairbrush.He was lying shamelessly: for these objects belonged to his master; but he knew that it is always good to boast.« Once again, leave me alone, repeated the garter, I am not accustomed to such behavior.– You're just a prude! said the false collar who wanted to have the last word. Soon after they were both pulled out of the laundry, then they were pressed, spread out in the sun to dry, and finally placed on the ironing board. The starch arrived(1). "Madam, said the false collar, you have positively revived me: I feel an extraordinary heat in me, all my wrinkles have disappeared. Will you, by grace, accept me as your husband and allow me to dedicate this new youth that I owe to you."– Fool! said the machine as it passed over the false collar with the majestic impetuousness of a locomotive pulling wagons on the railway. The false collar was a little frightened at his edges, a pair of scissors appeared to trim him.« Oh ! said the false collar, you must be a first dancer; what wonderful agility you have in your legs! I've never seen anything more charming; no man could do what you do.– Certainly, replied the pair of scissors as it continued its operation.– You deserve to be a countess; everything I possess, I offer you in true gentleman (that is to say, my shoehorn and my hairbrush).– What insolence! cried the pair of scissors ; what folly! » And it made such a deep cut on the false collar that it put him out of service.« Now, I must address my hairbrush, thought he. "Miss, you have the most magnificent hair; do you not think it would be appropriate to marry?"– I am engaged to the shoehorn, replied her.– Engaged! said the false collar.He looked around him, and seeing no other object to whom he could address his attentions, he took, from that moment, marriage with hatred. Some time later, he was thrown into a ragman's bag, and taken to the paper factory. There, there was a great gathering of rags, the ends of one side, and the most common on the other. All of them had much to tell, but the false collar more than any.He was not just a braggart. "I have had many adventures, said he, and especially love adventures! But I was also a true gentleman; I even owned a shoehorn and a hairbrush that I hardly used. I will never forget my first passion: it was a kind and graceful little belt; when I left her, she threw herself into a bucket full of water. I knew then a certain widow who was literally all fire for me ; but I found her too animated complexion, and I let her despair so much that she turned black as coal. A first dancer, a real demon for character, made me a terrible wound because I refused to marry her. Finally, my hairbrush fell in love with me so passionately that it lost all its bristles. Yes, I have lived a lot ; but what I regret most is the garter... I mean the belt who threw herself into the bucket. Alas! It's only too true, I have many crimes on my conscience ; it's time for me to purify myself by becoming white paper.And the leaf coming from him did not remain white – precisely that on which his own story was first traced. All those who, like him, have become accustomed to boasting about things that are the opposite of the truth, are not thrown into the ragman's bag, changed into paper and forced, under this form, to make a public and detailed confession of their lies. But let them not take too much advantage of it; for at the very moment when they boast, each one reads on their face, in their expression and in their eyes, as if it were written: "There is not a word of truth in what I tell you. Instead of the great conqueror that I claim to be, see in me only a pitiful false collar whose little pomposity and chatter make up all its merit."

Les amours d’un faux colOnce upon a time, there was an elegant gentleman whose entire wardrobe consisted of a boot-pull and a hairbrush. – But he had the most beautiful false collar anyone had ever seen. This false collar had reached that age when one can reasonably think about marriage; and one day, by chance, it found itself in the washbasin with a stocking. "A thousand buttons!" exclaimed the false collar. "Never have I seen anything finer or more graceful. May I ask your name, mademoiselle?"– What matters that to you, replied the stocking.– I would be very happy to know where you live," said the false collar, undeterred by her reticence. "But the stocking, a nature as reserved as hers, judged it not fitting to answer such an impertinent question. "I suppose you are some kind of sash?" continued the false collar without flinching, and I dare say that the most useful qualities are joined in you with the most charming graces.– Pray, sir, do not speak to me; I do not think I have given you any reason for it," said the stocking.– Ah! mademoiselle, with such a lovely person as you, there is never a lack of pretext. One does not need to beat about the bush: one is immediately inspired and carried away," replied the false collar.– Please move away, sir, I beg," said the stocking.– Mademoiselle, I am a gentleman," declared the false collar proudly. "I have a boot-pull and a hairbrush." He was lying impudently: for these belonged to his master; but he knew it was always good to boast."Once again, move away," repeated the stocking. "I am not accustomed to such manners."– Well! you are a prude!" said the false collar, wanting to have the last word. Soon after, they were both pulled out of the washbasin and then pressed, spread in the sun to dry, and finally placed on the ironing board. The steam arrived(1). "Madam," said the false collar, "you have positively revived me: I feel an extraordinary warmth in me; all my wrinkles have disappeared. Dignify me with your grace and accept me as your husband to consecrate this new youth that you owe me."– Fool!" said the machine, passing over the false collar with the majestic impetuosity of a locomotive that pulls wagons on the railway.The false collar was a bit frayed at its edges; a pair of scissors presented themselves to trim it."Oh!" said the false collar, "you must be a first dancer; what wonderful agility you have in your legs! I have never seen anything more charming; no man could do what you do."– Certainly," replied the pair of scissors as it continued its operation."You deserve to be countess; everything that I possess, I offer you as a true gentleman (that is, me, my boot-pull and my hairbrush)."– What insolence! exclaimed the pair of scissors. "What vanity!" And she made such a deep cut in the false collar that it put him out of service."Now," thought he, "I must address myself to the hairbrush." "You have, mademoiselle, the most magnificent hair; do you not think it would be fitting for us to marry?"– I am engaged to the boot-pull, replied she."Engaged!" exclaimed the false collar.He looked around and, seeing no other object to which he could address his compliments, he took a dislike to marriage. Some time later, he was put in the sack of a ragpicker and carried to the paper manufacturer. There, he found a large gathering of rags: fine ones on one side, coarser ones on the other. They all had much to tell; but the false collar more than any. He was no less a braggart. "It is amazing how many adventures I have had," he said, and especially adventures of love! But also, I was a well-set gentleman; I even had a boot-pull and a hairbrush that I hardly used. I shall never forget my first passion: it was a little sash, very pretty and graceful indeed. When I left her, she was so sad that she threw herself into a bucket of water. I then knew a certain widow who was literally all aflame for me; but I found her too animated in the face, and I let her despair to such an extent that she turned as black as coal. A first dancer, true demon for my fiery disposition, gave me a terrible wound because I refused to marry her. Finally, my hairbrush fell so deeply in love with me that it lost all its bristles. Yes, I have lived much; but what I regret most is the stocking… I mean the sash that drowned in the bucket. Alas! it is true enough, I have many crimes on my conscience; it is time for me to be purified by passing into the state of white paper." And the false collar was transformed, like the other rags, into paper.But the sheet that came from him did not remain white – precisely the one on which his own story had first been traced. All those who, like him, are accustomed to boast of things that are quite the opposite of the truth are not always thrown into the ragpicker's sack, changed into paper and obliged, in this form, to make a public and detailed confession of their blabbering. But let them not take too much pride in this advantage; for at the very moment they are boasting, each one reads on his face, in his air and in his eyes, as if it were written: "There is not a word of truth in what I am telling you. Instead of being a great victor that I claim to be, see me only as a feeble false collar whose little bit of weight and chatter make up all the merit."

One doesn’t have to fight for one’s advantage: inspiration strikes, one is swept away.– Please, sir, move away from me, and cease your importunities.– I am a gentleman, said the false collar proudly, “I possess a pull-on boot and a hairbrush.” He lied impudently: for they belonged to his master; but he knew it was always good to boast.– Once again, move away, repeated the garter, “I am not accustomed to such manners.”– Well! You’re just a prude!” he retorted, determined to have the last word. Soon after, they were both pulled from the laundry tub, then weighed, spread out in the sun to dry, and finally placed on the ironing board.

Deign, if you will accept me as your husband, to allow me to dedicate this new youth I owe to you.”– You fool!” said the press, passing over the false collar with the majestic impetuosity of a locomotive pulling wagons on a railway line.The false collar was a little frayed at the edges, and a pair of scissors appeared to trim him.“Oh! you must be a prima ballerina,” said the false collar, “what a marvelous agility you have in your legs!

The Loves of a False CollarOnce upon a time, there was a dapper gentleman whose entire wardrobe consisted of a bootjack and a hairbrush. But he possessed the most magnificent false collar ever seen. This collar had reached an age where marriage was a reasonable consideration, and one day, by chance, he found himself in the laundry tub alongside a garter. “Good heavens!” he exclaimed, “I’ve never beheld anything so delicate and graceful. Might I, madam, inquire as to your name?”“What concern is that of yours?” replied the garter.“I would be delighted to know your address.” But the garter, of a reserved nature, deemed the question too indiscreet to answer. “You are, I presume, a type of belt?” continued the false collar, undeterred. “And I dare say you combine the most useful qualities with the most captivating graces.”“Sir, I beg you, do not address me. I have given you no cause to do so.”“Ah, madam, with a creature as lovely as yourself, pretexts are never lacking. One needn’t strive – inspiration comes immediately, one is swept away.”“Sir, I implore you to withdraw, and cease your importunities.”“Madam, I am a gentleman,” declared the false collar proudly. “I possess a bootjack and a hairbrush.” He lied shamelessly, for these items belonged to his master, but he knew boasting was always a good strategy.“Once again, I ask you to leave,” repeated the garter. “I am not accustomed to such manners.”“Well, you are simply a prude!” retorted the false collar, determined to have the last word. Soon after, they were both lifted from the laundry, pinned out to dry in the sun, and finally placed on the ironing board. The pressing iron approached(1). “Madam,” said the false collar, “you have positively revived me! I feel an extraordinary warmth within, all my wrinkles have vanished. I beseech you, by accepting me as your husband, allow me to dedicate this newfound youth to you.”“Fool!” said the iron as it passed over the false collar with the majestic force of a locomotive pulling carriages along the railway. The false collar was a little frayed around the edges, and a pair of scissors presented itself to trim him.“Oh!” said the false collar. “You must be a prima ballerina! What marvelous agility you possess! I have never seen anything so charming. No man could do what you do.”“Indeed,” replied the scissors as it continued its work.“You deserve to be a countess. Everything I own, I offer to you, as a true gentleman (that is to say, myself, my bootjack, and my hairbrush).”“What insolence! What vanity!” cried the scissors, and it made a cut so deep in the false collar that it rendered him useless.“Now, I must address the hairbrush,” he thought. “Madam, you have the most magnificent tresses. Do you not think it is time you were married?”“I am engaged to the bootjack,” she replied.“Engaged!” exclaimed the false collar.He looked around, and seeing no other object to whom he might offer his attentions, he took a dislike to marriage. Some time later, he was thrown into a ragpicker’s sack and taken to a paper mill. There, a large gathering of rags had assembled, the finer pieces on one side, and the coarser on the other. They all had stories to tell, but the false collar more than any. He was the greatest braggart of them all. “It’s appalling how many adventures I’ve had,” he said, “and especially amorous ones! But I was a gentleman of the highest standing; I even had a bootjack and a hairbrush, which I rarely used. I shall never forget my first passion: it was a little belt, so kind and graceful. When I left her, she was so heartbroken she threw herself into a bucket of water. I later knew a widow who was literally consumed with passion for me, but I found her complexion too lively, and she despaired so deeply she turned as black as coal. A prima ballerina, a veritable firebrand, wounded me terribly because I refused to marry her. Finally, my hairbrush fell so desperately in love with me she lost all her bristles. Yes, I have lived a full life, but what I regret most is the garter… I mean, the belt who drowned in the bucket. Alas, it is true, I have many crimes on my conscience. It is time I purified myself by becoming blank paper.” And so, the false collar, along with the other rags, was transformed into paper.But the sheet derived from him did not remain blank – it is precisely the one on which his own story was first traced. All those, like him, who have accustomed themselves to boasting of things that are the very opposite of the truth, are not simply thrown into the rag sack, turned into paper, and forced, in this form, to make a public and detailed confession of their falsehoods. But let them not take too much pride in this advantage, for, at the very moment they boast, everyone reads on their face, in their manner, and in their eyes, as if it were written: “There is not a word of truth in what I tell you. Instead of the great victor I pretend to be, see in me only a pathetic false collar, whose little affectations and empty chatter constitute all its merit.”

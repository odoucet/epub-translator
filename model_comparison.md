Chapitre3Le Bien des pauvresUn curé vertueux et sans intrigue est une Providence pour le village.FLEURY.Il faut savoir que le curé de Verrières, vieillard de quatre-vingts ans, mais qui devait à l’air vif de ces montagnes une santé et un caractère de fer, avait le droit de visiter à toute heure la prison, l’hôpital et même le dépôt de mendicité. C’était précisément à six heures du matin que M. Appert, qui de Paris était recommandé au curé, avait eu la sagesse d’arriver dans une petite ville curieuse. Aussitôt il était allé au presbytère.En lisant la lettre que lui écrivait M. le marquis de La Mole, pair de France, et le plus riche propriétaire de la province, le curé Chélan resta pensif.Je suis vieux et aimé ici, se dit-il enfin à mi-voix, ils n’oseraient ! Se tournant tout de suite vers le monsieur de Paris, avec des yeux où, malgré le grand âge, brillait ce feu sacré qui annonce le plaisir de faire une belle action un peu dangereuse :– Venez avec moi, monsieur, et en présence du geôlier et surtout des surveillants du dépôt de mendicité, veuillez n’émettre aucune opinion sur les choses que nous verrons. M. Appert comprit qu’il avait affaire à un homme de cœur : il suivit le vénérable curé, visita la prison, l’hospice, le dépôt, fit beaucoup de questions et, malgré d’étranges réponses, ne se permit pas la moindre marque de blâme.Cette visite dura plusieurs heures. Le curé invita à dîner M. Appert, qui prétendit avoir des lettres à écrire : il ne voulait pas compromettre davantage son généreux compagnon. Vers les trois heures, ces messieurs allèrent achever l’inspection du dépôt de mendicité, et revinrent ensuite à la prison. Là, ils trouvèrent sur la porte le geôlier, espèce de géant de six pieds de haut et à jambes arquées ; sa figure ignoble était devenue hideuse par l’effet de la terreur.– Ah ! monsieur, dit-il au curé, dès qu’il l’aperçut, ce monsieur que je vois là avec vous, n’est-il pas M. Appert ?– Qu’importe ? dit le curé.– C’est que depuis hier j’ai l’ordre le plus précis, et que M. le préfet a envoyé par un gendarme, qui a dû galoper toute la nuit, de ne pas admettre M. Appert dans la prison.– Je vous déclare, monsieur Noiroud, dit le curé, que ce voyageur, qui est avec moi, est M. Appert. Reconnaissez-vous que j’ai le droit d’entrer dans la prison à toute heure du jour et de la nuit, et en me faisant accompagner par qui je veux ?– Oui, M. le curé, dit le geôlier à voix basse, et baissant la tête comme un bouledogue que fait obéir à regret la crainte du bâton. Seulement, M. le curé, j’ai femme et enfants, si je suis dénoncé on me destituera ; je n’ai pour vivre que ma place.– Je serais aussi bien fâché de perdre la mienne, reprit le bon curé, d’une voix de plus en plus émue.

Appert, le curé de Paris, qui l’avait suivi avec une expression d’intérêt. « Seul, je suis un homme de peu de valeur, mais avec vous, je suis un serviteur utile. »Cette conversation, qui se déroulait dans le salon du presbytère, était interrompue par le bruit des chevaux qui s’approchaient.

Chapter3The Poor’s WelfareA virtuous and uncalculating priest is a blessing to a village.FLEURY.It must be known that the priest of Verrières, an octogenarian, yet possessing the vigor of these mountains in his health and character, had the right to visit the prison, the hospital, and even the almshouse at any hour. It was precisely six in the morning that M. Appert, recommended from Paris to the priest, had arrived in a curious little town. Immediately, he went to the presbytery.Reading the letter that M. the Marquis de La Mole, a Peer of France and the wealthiest landowner in the province, had written to him, Priest Chélan remained thoughtful.“I am old and beloved here,” he murmured to himself, “they would not dare!” Turning immediately to the gentleman from Paris, with eyes in which, despite his great age, shone that sacred fire that announces the pleasure of performing a somewhat dangerous good deed:“I want you to accompany me,” he said.This arrangement suited more than one way, continued M. de Rênal, looking at his wife with a diplomatic air.“The Valenod is delighted with the two fine Normans he has just bought for his carriage. But he has no tutor for his children.”“He could well take ours,” she replied.“You approve of my plan?” M. de Rênal said, thanking his wife for the excellent idea she had just had. “Let’s decide it.”“Good heavens, my dear friend, how quickly you take a decision!”“Because I have character, and the priest has seen that.” Let us not conceal it, the inhabitants of the town considered her to be simple, because she let slip the most beautiful opportunities to buy beautiful hats from Paris or Besançon. As long as she was allowed to wander freely in her beautiful garden, she never complained.It was a naive soul, who had never even risen to judge her husband, and to admit to herself that he bored her. She assumed, without realizing it, that there were no sweeter relationships between husband and wife. She especially loved M. de Rênal when he spoke to her about his plans for their children, one of whom he intended for the military, the second for the magistracy, and the third for the church.This conjugal judgment was reasonable. The mayor of Verrières owed a reputation for wit and above all good manners to a dozen anecdotes inherited from an uncle. The old Captain de Rênal served before the revolution in the regiment of infantry of M. the Duke of Orléans, and when he went to Paris, he was admitted to the salons of the prince. He had seen Mme de Montesson, the famous Mme de Genlis, M. Ducrest, the inventor of the Palais-Royal. These characters reappeared too often in M. de Rênal’s anecdotes. But little by little, this memory of such delicate things to recount had become a labor for him, and for some time, he repeated his anecdotes relating to the house of Orléans only on great occasions.

Chapter3A virtuous and unambitious priest is a blessing for the village.FLEURY.It should be noted that the parish priest of Verrières, an eighty-year-old man but with a health and character of iron due to the bracing mountain air, had the right to visit at any hour the prison, the hospital, and even the poorhouse. It was precisely at six in the morning that M. Appert, who was recommended to the priest from Paris, had the wisdom to arrive in a small curious city.As he read the letter in which M. le marquis de La Mole, pair of France and the richest landowner in the province, recommended him, Father Chélan remained thoughtful.I am old and loved here, he said to himself aloud, they wouldn't dare! Turning immediately to the Parisian gentleman, with eyes that, despite his great age, shone with a sacred fire announcing the pleasure of doing a good action, however dangerous:"Come with me, sir, and in the presence of the jailer and especially the supervisors of the poorhouse, please do not express any opinion on the things we will see." M. Appert understood that he was dealing with a man of heart: he followed the venerable priest, visited the prison, the hospice, the poorhouse, asked many questions, and despite strange answers, did not allow himself the slightest sign of blame.This visit lasted several hours. The priest invited M. Appert to dinner, who claimed to have letters to write: he did not want to compromise his generous companion further. Around three o'clock, these gentlemen went to complete the inspection of the poorhouse and returned later to the prison. There they found on the door the jailer, a kind of giant six feet tall with bowed legs; his ignoble face had become ugly due to fear."Ah! sir," he said to the priest as soon as he saw him, "is not this gentleman I see with you M. Appert?""It doesn't matter," said the priest."Well, since yesterday I have received the most precise order, and the prefect sent it through a gendarme who had to gallop all night, not to admit M. Appert in the prison.""I declare to you, Monsieur Noiroud," said the priest, "that this traveler, who is with me, is M. Appert. Do you recognize that I have the right to enter the prison at any hour of the day or night and be accompanied by whoever I want?""Yes, Father," said the jailer in a low voice, and lowering his head like a bulldog that obeys reluctantly with the stick. "However, Father, I have a wife and children; if I am denounced, they will remove me; I only have my place to live.""I would be just as upset to lose mine," replied the good priest, his voice growing more and more emotional."What a difference!" exclaimed the jailer sharply; "you, Father, everyone knows that you have 800 livres of income, good property in the sun...

Chapter3The Good of the PoorA virtuous and unassuming priest is a blessing for the village.FLEURY.The priest of Verrières, an octogenarian with an iron constitution and character, thanks to the crisp mountain air, had the right to visit the prison, hospital, and even the poorhouse at any hour. It was precisely at six in the morning that M. Appert, recommended by a letter from Paris, arrived in this curious little town. He immediately went to the presbytery.The priest Chélan read the letter from M. le marquis de La Mole, peer of France and the wealthiest landowner in the province, with a thoughtful expression.I am old and loved here, he murmured to himself. They wouldn't dare! He turned to the gentleman from Paris, his eyes still burning with that sacred fire that signals the pleasure of performing a slightly dangerous good deed:– Come with me, sir, and in the presence of the jailer and especially the overseers of the poorhouse, do not express any opinions about what we see. M. Appert understood he was dealing with a man of heart: he followed the venerable priest, visited the prison, the hospice, the poorhouse, asked many questions, and despite some strange answers, did not utter the slightest reproach.This visit lasted several hours.

Appert?The priest nodded gravely.– I have strict orders, continued the jailer, to prevent him from entering the prison or the poorhouse. The mayor has forbidden it.M. Appert looked at the priest with a questioning gaze.The priest's eyes flashed with anger. He turned to M. Appert and said:– Sir, I am sorry for this inconvenience. But I assure you that I will do everything in my power to rectify this situation.M. Appert nodded understandingly and left the premises with a heavy heart.The priest, meanwhile, stormed into the mayor's office, demanding an explanation for this outrageous behavior. The mayor, taken aback by the priest's fury, stammered an apology and promised to lift the ban immediately.Mme de Rênal, a tall, well-built woman who had once been the beauty of the region, was known for her simplicity and youthful grace. She had a certain naivety that would have seemed charming to a Parisian, full of innocence and vivacity. If she had known about such successes, Mme de Rênal would have been deeply ashamed. Neither coquetry nor affection had ever touched this heart.M. Valenod, the wealthy director of the poorhouse, was said to have courted her without success, which had cast a singular light on her virtue; for this M.

Chapitre3The Poor Man’s DueA virtuous and unassuming priest is a blessing to his village.FLEURY.Old Father Chélan, the priest of Verrières, though eighty years of age, owed his robust health and spirited nature to the bracing mountain air. He possessed the right to visit the prison, the hospital, and even the poorhouse at any hour. It was precisely at six in the morning that Monsieur Appert, recommended to the priest by the Marquis de La Mole of Paris, had arrived in this curious little town. He went immediately to the presbytery.The priest was lost in thought as he read the letter from the Marquis de La Mole, a Peer of France and the wealthiest landowner in the province.“I am old and respected here,” he murmured to himself, “they wouldn’t dare.” Turning immediately to the gentleman from Paris, his eyes, despite his age, alight with that sacred fire that betrays a pleasure in undertaking a somewhat dangerous good deed:“Monsieur, I trust you will understand that I must maintain a certain discretion. I would not wish to cause unnecessary alarm.”This was said with a gentle firmness, a hint of authority that belied his kindly demeanor. He continued, “I have certain obligations, certain… considerations. I trust you will respect them.”This arrangement suited Monsieur de Rênal in more ways than one, he continued, glancing at his wife with a diplomatic air. “Valenod is immensely proud of the two fine Norman horses he’s just purchased for his carriage. But he has no tutor for his children.”“He could easily take this one.”“You approve of my plan?” asked Monsieur de Rênal, thanking his wife with a smile for the excellent idea she’d just had. “Good. It’s decided.”“Oh, my dear friend, how quickly you make up your mind!”“That’s because I have character, my dear, and the priest saw it. Let us not pretend, we are surrounded by liberals here. All these cloth merchants envy me, I am certain of it—two or three are becoming wealthy. Well, I like it when the children of Monsieur de Rênal go for a walk under the guidance of their tutor. It makes an impression. My grandfather used to tell us that, in his youth, he had a tutor. It will cost me a hundred écus, but this must be considered a necessary expense to maintain our standing.”This sudden resolution left Madame de Rênal lost in thought. She was a tall, well-formed woman who had once been the beauty of the region, as they said in these mountains. She possessed a certain air of simplicity, and a youthful grace in her movements. To a Parisian, this naive charm, full of innocence and vivacity, might even have evoked ideas of gentle voluptuousness. Had she known of such success, Madame de Rênal would have been deeply ashamed. Neither coquetry nor affection had ever approached this heart. Monsieur Valenod, the wealthy director of the poorhouse, was said to have courted her, but without success, which had lent a singular luster to her virtue.

Chapter 3The Good of the PoorA virtuous and unintriguing curé is a providence for the village.FLEURY.It must be known that the curé of Verrières, an old man of eighty years but with a health and character as strong as the mountain air, had the right to visit the prison, the hospital, and even the shelter for beggars at any hour. It was precisely at six o'clock in the morning that M. Appert, who had been recommended by Paris to the curé, arrived wisely in a curious small town. He immediately went to the presbytery.While reading the letter from M. de La Mole, the Marquis of France and the richest landowner in the province, Curé Chélan fell into thought.I am old but loved here, he said to himself at mid-voice, they wouldn't dare! Turning immediately towards the Parisian gentleman, with eyes where, despite his great age, a sacred fire shone, indicating pleasure in doing a beautiful and somewhat dangerous deed:– Come with me, sir, and in front of the jailer and especially the overseers of the shelter for beggars, please refrain from expressing any opinion on what we will see.

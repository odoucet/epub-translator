# EPUB Translator (Autonomous Version)

This project allows you to translate EPUB and PDF books using a local LLM like Mistral or Gemma (via Ollama) or any OpenAI-compatible API.  
It preserves HTML structure (headers, emphasis, lists), supports translator footnotes, and can output both EPUB and PDF.

---

## ✨ Features

- Translate EPUB files using chunked **HTML** input for structure preservation
- Supports multi-style prompts (literary, elegant, narrative)
- Outputs EPUB **and optional PDF** (`--pdf`)
- Resumable: tracks translation progress in a JSON workspace
- Supports local LLMs via **Ollama** and remote OpenAI-compatible APIs
- Translate the **entire book or just one chapter** with `--chapter`
- Compare model outputs on a chapter (`compare_models.py`)

---

## ⚠️ Legal Notice

> ❗ Use only with books in the **public domain** (author dead >70 years or explicitly free license).
> Do not use on copyrighted material.

---

## 🔒 DRM Protection Check

The translator automatically detects and **blocks translation of DRM-protected EPUB files** to ensure compliance with digital rights.

**Supported DRM detection:**
- ✅ **Readium LCP** (license.lcpl)
- ✅ **Adobe ADEPT** (rights.xml with Adobe algorithms)
- ✅ **Barnes & Noble** (characteristic encrypted keys)
- ✅ **Apple FairPlay** (sinf.xml signatures)
- ✅ **Unknown encrypted content** (generic encryption detection)

**What happens if DRM is detected:**
```
🔒 Vérification DRM du fichier EPUB...
❌ DRM détecté: Adobe ADEPT
❌ Impossible de traduire un fichier EPUB protégé par DRM
💡 Veuillez utiliser un fichier EPUB sans DRM
```

## 🐳 Docker Setup

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and run:
   ```bash
   ollama pull mistral
   ollama pull gemma:2b
   ollama pull nous-hermes2
   ```

2. Build and launch translator with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

---

## 🚀 Translate a Book

```bash
python cli.py --file book.epub -l french --prompt-style literary --pdf
python cli.py --file book.pdf -l french --prompt-style literary
```

Options:
- `--chapter 3` → translate only chapter 3
- `--workspace` → resume from previous translation progress
- `--model mistral` → use a specific model
- `--url http://localhost:11434` → custom API endpoint
- PDF input is supported via text extraction; the output remains an EPUB (and optional PDF export via `--pdf`)

---

## 🔁 Compare LLM Models

To compare model outputs on chapter 3:

```bash
python cli.py --file book.epub -l french -p literary --compare gemma3:1b,mistral:7b --chapter 3 -o model_comparison.md
```

Our own tests show:
* **gemma3:1b**: hard to keep HTML structure and follow prompt exactly
* **other gemma3 models**: all timeout, to be investigated
* **mistral:7b**: hard to keep HTML structure and follow prompt exactly
* **mistral-small:24b**: good (but slow)
* **dorian2b/vera**: works very well on small chunks

---

## 🧪 Requirements

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need `pandoc` + `pdflatex` installed if using `--pdf`.

---

## ✉️ Prompt Styles

Available prompt styles in `libs/prompts.py`:
- **`literary-v2`**: enhanced literary style with stricter translation guidelines and no summarizing
- **`literary`**: expressive and narrative with optional translator notes
- **`elegant`**: fluent and idiomatic with structure preservation  
- **`narrative`**: free but faithful rephrasing of content with tag retention

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

Test specific functionality:
```bash
pytest tests/test_epub_utils.py::TestDRMDetection -v
```

---

## TODO
- [ ] improve prompts to better handle HTML structure (lots of failures)
- [ ] add openai-compatible API support
- [ ] add "literal" translation style

## Comparaison des traductions par modèle et prompt

*Note: Le texte source est fictif et volontairement riche en idiomes français pour tester la capacité de traduction des nuances linguistiques.*
